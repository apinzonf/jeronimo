  Abstract                 = {The idea of Phong Shading is applied to subdivision surfaces: normals are associated with vertices and the same construction is used for both locations and normals. This creates vertex positions and normals. The vertex normals are smoother than the normals of the subdivision surface and using vertex normals for shading attenuates the well known visual artifacts of many subdivision schemes. We demonstrate how to apply subdivision to normals and how blend and combine different normals for achieving a variety of effects.},

We present here a principled approach for constructing geometric discrete Laplacians on surfaces with arbitrary polygonal faces, encompassing non-planar and non-convex polygons. Our construction is guided by closely mimicking structural properties of the smooth Laplace--Beltrami operator. Among other features, our construction leads to an extension of the widely employed cotan formula from triangles to polygons. Besides carefully laying out theoretical aspects, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach for a variety of geometry processing applications, embarking on situations that would have been more difficult to achieve based on geometric Laplacians for simplicial meshes or purely combinatorial Laplacians for general meshes.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years a considerable amount of work in graphics and geometric optimization used tools based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a surface. The applications of the Laplacian include mesh editing, surface smoothing, and shape interpolations among others. However, it has been shown [13, 24, 26] that the popular cotangent approximation schemes do not provide convergent point-wise (or even L2) estimates, while many applications rely on point-wise estimation. Existence of such schemes has been an open question [13].

In this paper we propose the first algorithm for approximating the Laplace operator of a surface from a mesh with point-wise convergence guarantees applicable to arbitrary meshed surfaces. We show that for a sufficiently fine mesh over an arbitrary surface, our mesh Laplacian is close to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the surface at every point of the surface.

Moreover, the proposed algorithm is simple and easily implementable. Experimental evidence shows that our algorithm exhibits convergence empirically and compares favorably with cotangentbased methods in providing accurate approximation of the Laplace operator for various meshes.},

For non-rectangular meshes, it generates surfaces that are shown to reduce to a standard B-spline surface except at a small number of points, called extraordinary points. Therefore, everywhere except at these points the surface is continuous in tangent and curvature. At the extraordinary points, the pictures of the surface indicate that the surface is at least continuous in tangent, but no proof of continuity is given. A similar algorithm for biquadratic B-splines is also presented.}},

  Abstract                 = {Uniform offsetting is an important geometric operation for computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications such as rapid prototyping, NC machining, coordinate measuring machines, robot collision avoidance, and Hausdorff error calculation. We present a novel method for offsetting (grown and shrunk) a solid model by an arbitrary distance r. First, offset polygons are directly computed for each face, edge, and vertex of an input solid model. The computed polygonal meshes form a continuous boundary; however, such a boundary is invalid since there exist meshes that are closer to the original model than the given distance r as well as self-intersections. Based on the problematic polygonal meshes, we construct a well-structured point-based model, Layered Depth-Normal Image (LDNI), in three orthogonal directions. The accuracy of the generated point-based model can be controlled by setting the tessellation and sampling rates during the construction process. We then process all the sampling points in the model by using a set of point filters to delete all the invalid points. Based on the remaining points, we construct a two-manifold polygonal contour as the resulting offset boundary. Our method is general, simple and efficient. We report experimental results on a variety of CAD models and discuss various applications of the developed uniform offsetting method.},

One of the biggest challenges is that a good linear element may become invalid when mid-side nodes are introduced. To help alleviate this problem, a new objective function for optimization-based smoothing is proposed for triangular and quadrilateral elements, linear or quadratic. Unlike the current popular approaches, this objective function makes it possible for a smoothing algorithm to untangle and smooth in a single process. This objective function has higher order continuous derivatives and only one minimum, if any, that make it suitable for optimization techniques. Even though optimization-based smoothing obtains much higher quality results compared to other algorithms, such as constrained Laplacian smoothing, it is also slower than these algorithms. That said, we also present an effective way to limit the number of calls to optimization-based smoothing such that the highest quality mesh is obtained in the least amount of time.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a weighted progressive method for constructing a Loop subdivision surface interpolating a given mesh. The convergent rate of the weighted progressive interpolation can be controlled by adjusting the weight of the iteration. For different weights in the available range, the limit meshes are the same as that of the reverse solution by directly solving a linear system. The theoretical value for the optimal weight is given based on the smallest eigenvalue of the collocation matrix. An appropriate value of the weight is assigned based on both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we develop methods to rapidly remove rough features from irregularly triangulated data intended to portray a smooth sur- face. The main task is to remove undesirable noise and uneven edges while retaining desirable geometric features. The problem arises mainly when creating high-fidelity computer graphics objects using imperfectly-measured data from the real world. Our approach contains three novel features: an implicit integra- tion method to achieve efficiency, stability, and large time-steps; a scale-dependent Laplacian operator to improve the diffusion pro- cess; and finally, a robust curvature flow operator that achieves a smoothing of the shape itself, distinct from any parameterization. Additional features of the algorithm include automatic exact vol- ume preservation, and hard and soft constraints on the positions of the points in the mesh. We compare our method to previous operators and related algo- rithms, and prove that our curvature and Laplacian operators have several mathematically-desirable qualities that improve the appear- ance of the resulting surface. In consequence, the user can easily select the appropriate operator according to the desired type of fair- ing. Finally, we provide a series of examples to graphically and numerically demonstrate the quality of our results.},

We introduce iWires, a novel approach based on the argument that man-made models can be distilled using a few special 1D wires and their mutual relations. We hypothesize that maintaining the properties of such a small number of wires allows preserving the defining characteristics of the entire object. We introduce an analyze-and-edit approach, where prior to editing, we perform a light-weight analysis of the input shape to extract a descriptive set of wires. Analyzing the individual and mutual properties of the wires, and augmenting them with geometric attributes makes them intelligent and ready to be manipulated. Editing the object by modifying the intelligent wires leads to a powerful editing framework that retains the original design intent and object characteristics. We show numerous results of manipulation of man-made shapes using our editing technique.},

A sculpting tool is controlled by a 3D input device and the material is represented by voxel data; the tool acts by modifying the values in the voxel array, much as a "paint" program's "paintbrush" modifies bitmap values. The voxel data is converted to a polygonal surface using a "marching-cubes" algorithm; since the modifications to the voxel data are local, we accelerate this computation by an incremental algorithm and accelerate the display by using a special data structure for determining which polygons must be redrawn in a particular screen region. We provide a variety of tools: one that cuts away material, one that adds material, a "sandpaper" tool, a "heat gun," etc. The technique provides an intuitive direct interaction, as if the user were working with clay or wax. The models created are free-form and may have complex topology; however, they are not precise, so the technique is appropriate for modeling a boulder or a tooth but not for modeling a crankshaft.},

  Abstract                 = {Sculpting deformation is a powerful tool to modify the shape of objects intuitively. However, the detail preserving problem has not been considered in sculpting deformation. In the deformation of a source object by pressing a primitive object against it, the source object is deformed while geometric details of the object should be maintained. In order to address this problem, we present a detail preserving sculpting deformation algorithm by using Laplacian coordinates. Based on the property of Laplacian coordinate, we propose two feature invariants to encode the Laplacian coordinate. Instead of mapping the source mesh to the primitive mesh, we map the smooth version of source mesh to the primitive mesh and use the Laplacian coordinates to encode the geometric details. When the smooth version of the source mesh is deformed, the Laplacian coordinates of the deformed mesh are computed for each vertex firstly and then the deformed mesh is reconstructed by solving a linear system that satisfies the reconstruction of the local details in least squares sense. Several examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {The spectral approach to signal processing has led to a huge number of well known techniques, most prominently present in the area of analog and digital audio signal processing;
every older child knows what it means to manipulate the high, low or mid frequencies at their audio player. Therefore it is a natural question to ask how one can formulate the notion of spectral processing on polygonal meshes. A polygonal mesh can be regarded as the discrete signal of the vertex coordinates together with connectivity information. In his seminal paper Taubin [Tau95] suggested to exploit the analogy between the second derivative for real valued functions over R and the so called Laplace-Beltrami operator on surfaces. This idea is motivated by the fact that spectral signal processing on periodic time-dependent discrete signals amounts to modifying the different frequency components of the signal. The frequency components are obtained by projecting the signal in a system of orthogonal sin and cos functions. Note, that sin(nx) and cos(nx) respectively are eigenfunctions of the second derivative, that is, they reproduce under the action of the second derivative up to a constant factor. The signal of mesh coordinates naturally lives on the surface itself. Therefore, it makes sense, in analogy to the 1-dimensional case, to project the coordinates onto the eigenfunctions of the second derivative of the surface, the Laplace-Beltrami operator. This analogy is one among many reason for the interest in the discretization of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (or Laplacian for short) on discrete surfaces. The Laplacian of a surface determines, to a certain extend, the topology and geometry of the surface itself. More specifically, the eigenvalues of the Laplacian encode properties of the surface like Betti numbers and area. On the other hand it captures the metric of a surface. The Laplacian is therefore a central tool for investigating how global geometry emerges from local geometry and has become one of the central elements in computational geometry processing. The academic world prefers to work with triangular meshes which admit easy theoretic treatment, the movie industry on the other hand generally prefers quad meshes for practical reasons. It is therefore an important area of research to find generalizations of well known constructions on triangular meshes to polygonal meshes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper systematically studies the well-known Mexican hat wavelet (MHW) on manifold geometry, including its derivation, properties, transforms, and applications. The MHW is rigorously derived from the heat kernel by taking the negative first-order derivative with respect to time. As a solution to the heat equation, it has a clear initial condition: the Laplace?Beltrami operator. Following a popular methodology in mathematics, we analyze the MHW and its transforms from a Fourier perspective. By formulating Fourier transforms of bivariate kernels and convolutions, we obtain its explicit expression in the Fourier domain, which is a scaled differential operator continuously dilated via heat diffusion. The MHW is localized in both space and frequency, which enables space-frequency analysis of input functions. We defined its continuous and discrete transforms as convolutions of bivariate kernels, and propose a fast method to compute convolutions by Fourier transform. To broaden its application scope, we apply the MHW to graphics problems of feature detection and geometry processing.},

The method takes into consideration the possible distortion of the surfaces while the smoothness of the blending surface connecting the objects is maintained. A blend region between the given object surfaces is located. The topology of the surfaces in the vicinity of the blend region is refined and the boundary curves of the blend region are smoothed to reduce possible distortion in the blending surface. A blend curve between the two surfaces is used for connecting the given surfaces. Vertices on the blend curve are regular whereas extraordinary vertices are restricted to locate along the boundary of the blend region. Locations of the blend vertices are adjusted such that the curvature of the surfaces along the boundaries of the blend region is minimized. This ensures extraordinary vertices on the boundaries to lie on a relatively flat region, and hence, minimizes the distortion of the surfaces in the merging process.},

Teddy, our prototype system, is implemented as a Java program, and the mesh construction is done in real-time on a standard PC. Our informal user study showed that a first-time user typically masters the operations within 10 minutes, and can construct interesting 3D models within minutes.},

  Abstract                 = {Arbitrary polygonal meshes play an important role in 3D model representation and surface modeling. Most of the previous smoothing approaches are however, mainly designed for triangular meshes. This paper proposes a unified approach to address fairing problems of arbitrary polygonal meshes. The approach is built upon an assumption that all face centroids of a smoothed mesh locate on its noise-free surface and remain unchanged during the smoothing process in order to prevent the resulted mesh from shrinkage and preserve surface features. Boundary smoothing is considered in a similar way as well but the process is independent to mesh processing such that two, noisy meshes sharing a boundary still adjoin continuously after smoothing. Finally, a Taubin-like inflation operator is employed to further improve the ability of anti-shrinkage. Although very simple iterative equation is employed in the smoothing procedure, experiments demonstrate that the approach is able to not only effectively address the problem of shrinkage and distortion but also preserve features very well.},

The basic idea is constructing the subdivision rule for new inserted vertices of a new interpolatory subdivision scheme based on an approximating subdivision algorithm applied to a local configuration of the mesh with one vertex updated for interpolation of the vertex. This idea is demonstrated by presenting two new interpolatory subdivision schemes based on Catmull?Clark subdivision for an arbitrary polygonal mesh and Loop subdivision for a triangular mesh, respectively. These algorithms are simple and have a small stencil for computing new points. The new perspective also shows a link between those classic approximating and interpolatory subdivision algorithms such as cubic B-spline curve subdivision and the four-point interpolatory subdivision, Catmull?Clark subdivision and Kobbelt?s interpolatory scheme, and Loop subdivision and the butterfly algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Subdivision surfaces refer to a class of modelling schemes that define an object through recursive subdivision starting from an initial control mesh. Similar to B-splines, the final surface is defined by the vertices of the initial control mesh.

Today one can find a variety of subdivision schemes for geometric design and graphics applications. This paper provides an overview of subdivision surfaces with a particular emphasis on schemes generalizing splines. Some common issues on subdivision surface modelling are addressed. Several key topics, such as scheme construction, property analysis, parametric evaluation and subdivision surface fitting, are discussed. Some other important topics are also summarized for potential future research and development. Several examples are provided to highlight the modelling capability of subdivision surfaces for CAD applications.},

Subdivision theory explains that inherently, for standard stationary subdivision algorithms, curvature-continuity and the ability to model all quadratic shapes requires a degree of at least bi-6. The existence of a simple-to-implement C2 subdivision algorithm generating surfaces of good shape and piecewise degree bi-3 in the polar setting is therefore a welcome surprise. This paper presents such an algorithm, the underlying insights, and a detailed analysis. In bi-3 C2 polar subdivision the weights depend, as in standard schemes, only on the valence, but the valence at one central polar vertex increases to match Catmull-Clark-refinement.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a framework for triangle shape optimization and feature preserving smoothing of triangular meshes that is guided by the vertex Laplacians, specifically, the uniformly weighted Laplacian and the discrete mean curvature normal. Vertices are relocated so that they approximate prescribed Laplacians and positions in a weighted least-squares sense; the resulting linear system leads to an efficient, non-iterative solution. We provide different weighting schemes and demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on a number of detailed and highly irregular meshes; our technique successfully improves the quality of the triangulation while remaining faithful to the original surface geometry, and it is also capable of smoothing the surface while preserving geometric features.},

The refinement step tries to find a good approximation of the fine points while minimizing the local energy of the coarse points in a least-squares sense. This approach is then used to find smooth reverse of the Loop and Catmullâ??Clark subdivisions.

We argue that geometric detail is an intrinsic property of a surface and that, consequently, surface editing is best performed by operating over an intrinsic surface representation. We provide such a representation of a surface, based on the Laplacian of the mesh, by encoding each vertex relative to its neighborhood. The Laplacian of the mesh is enhanced to be invariant to locally linearized rigid transformations and scaling. Based on this Laplacian representation, we develop useful editing operations: interactive free-form deformation in a region of interest based on the transformation of a handle, transfer and mixing of geometric details between two surfaces, and transplanting of a partial surface mesh onto another surface. The main computation involved in all operations is the solution of a sparse linear system, which can be done at interactive rates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several examples, showing that the editing operations change the shape while respecting the structural geometric detail.},

We show that the surface and all its derivatives can be evaluated in terms of asetof eigenbasis functions which depend only on the subdivi-sion scheme and we derive analytical expressions for these basis functions. In particular, on the regular part of the control mesh where Catmull-Clark surfaces are bi-cubic B-splines, the eigenba-sis is equal to the power basis. Also, our technique is both easy to implement and efficient. We have used our implementation to compute high quality curvature plots of subdivision surfaces. The cost of our evaluation scheme is comparable to that of a bi-cubic spline. Therefore, our method allows many algorithms developed for parametric surfaces to be applied to Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces. This makes subdivision surfaces an even more attractive tool for free-form surface modeling},

Our insight is that the use of quasi-uniform mesh sampling, an interesting option now that very large meshes can be edited and displayed in real-time, provides the right framework for expressing and efficiently processing arbitrary changes of topological genus. The user controls deformation by gesture: he sweeps tools that apply a variety of deformation fields, from smoothing and trimming ones to local inflation and constant volume deformation tools. Meanwhile, the quasi-regular mesh seamlessly splits or locally blends when and where needed, while still following the user-specified deformation. Our method guarantees a closed, self-intersection-free mesh, whatever the user action. We demonstrate the practical usability of the resulting, interactive sculpting system through the sculpture of models that would have been extremely difficult to achieve with both current research methods and state of the art professional software.},

  Abstract                 = {A local smoothing operator applied in the reverse direction is used to obtain planar shape enhancement and exaggeration. Inversion of a smoothing operator is an inherently unstable operation. Therefore, a stable numerical scheme simulating the inverse smoothing effect is introduced. Enhancement is obtained for short time spans of evolution. Carrying the evolution further yields shape exaggeration or caricaturization effect. Introducing attraction forces between the evolving shape and the initial one, yields an enhancement process that converges to a steady state. These forces depend on the distance of the evolving curve from the original one and on local properties. Results of applying the unrestrained and restrained evolution on planar shapes, based on a stabilized inverse geometric heat equation, are presented showing enhancement and caricaturization effects},

It belongs to the class of vector subdivision schemes; for each vertex, we have three control points that form a control triangle tangent to the surface instead of one control point. The main advantage of this scheme is that we can choose the values of the normals in the initial vertices which results in more design possibilities. At first sight, it is an approximating scheme because the control points change each iteration. However, the point where the control triangle is tangent to the surface remains the same. Therefore, it is an interpolating scheme. In the regular regions, we use the uniform Powell-Sabin rules, and we develop additional subdivision rules for the new vertices in the neighborhood of extraordinary vertices. The scheme yields C1 continuous surfaces. We also do the convergence analysis based on the eigenproperties of the subdivision matrix and the properties of the characteristic map.},

  Abstract                 = {Mesh denoising is crucial for improving noisy meshes acquired from scanning devices and digitization processes. This paper proposes a general, robust approach for mesh denoising by using a combination of bilateral filtering, feature recognition, anisotropic neighborhood searching, and surface fitting and projection techniques. Motivated by the bilateral filtering from image processing applications, we develop a new bilateral filter operating on the normal vector fields of the mesh. Then, we detect mesh features and classify mesh vertices into non-feature vertices and feature vertices. The corresponding anisotropic neighborhoods for each vertex are searched by constructing a weighted dual graph, over which biquadratic Bezier surface patches are fitted and projected. The projection points are averaged to update each vertex of the mesh. The steps above are repeated iteratively until convergence, i.e., the Hausdorff distance between two sequential denoised meshes is less than a pre-defined threshold. A number of examples presented in the paper demonstrate that our method generally yields visually and numerically better denoising results, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Vertex- and face-based subdivision schemes are now routinely used in geometric modeling and computational science, and their primal/dual relationships are well studied. In this paper, we interpret these schemes as defining bases for discrete differential 0- resp. 2-forms, and complete the picture by introducing edge-based subdivision schemes to construct the missing bases for discrete differential 1-forms. Such subdivision schemes map scalar coefficients on edges from the coarse to the refined mesh and are intrinsic to the surface. Our construction is based on treating vertex-, edge-, and face-based subdivision schemes as a joint triple and enforcing that subdivision commutes with the topological exterior derivative. We demonstrate our construction for the case of arbitrary topology triangle meshes. Using Loop's scheme for 0-forms and generalized half-box splines for 2-forms results in a unique generalized spline scheme for 1-forms, easily incorporated into standard subdivision surface codes. We also provide corresponding boundary stencils. Once a metric is supplied, the scalar 1-form coefficients define a smooth tangent vector field on the underlying subdivision surface. Design of tangent vector fields is made particularly easy with this machinery as we demonstrate.},

In this paper, two new non-linear subdivision schemes, face based subdivision scheme and normal based subdivision scheme, are introduced for surface interpolation of triangular meshes. With a given coarse mesh more and more details will be added to the surface when the triangles have been split and refined. Because every intermediate mesh is a piecewise linear approximation to the final surface, the first type of subdivision scheme computes each new vertex as the solution to a least square fitting problem of selected old vertices and their neighboring triangles. Consequently, sharp features as well as smooth regions are generated automatically. For the second type of subdivision, the displacement for every new vertex is computed as a combination of normals at old vertices. By computing the vertex normals adaptively, the limit surface is G1 smooth. The fairness of the interpolating surface can be improved further by using the neighboring faces. Because the new vertices by either of these two schemes depend on the local geometry, but not the vertex valences, the interpolating surface inherits the shape of the initial control mesh more fairly and naturally. Several examples are also presented to show the efficiency of the new algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel technique for large deformations on 3D meshes using the volumetric graph Laplacian. We first construct a graph representing the volume inside the input mesh. The graph need not form a solid meshing of the input mesh's interior; its edges simply connect nearby points in the volume. This graph's Laplacian encodes volumetric details as the difference between each point in the graph and the average of its neighbors. Preserving these volumetric details during deformation imposes a volumetric constraint that prevents unnatural changes in volume. We also include in the graph points a short distance outside the mesh to avoid local self-intersections. Volumetric detail preservation is represented by a quadric energy function. Minimizing it preserves details in a least-squares sense, distributing error uniformly over the whole deformed mesh. It can also be combined with conventional constraints involving surface positions, details or smoothness, and efficiently minimized by solving a sparse linear system.We apply this technique in a 2D curve-based deformation system allowing novice users to create pleasing deformations with little effort. A novel application of this system is to apply nonrigid and exaggerated deformations of 2D cartoon characters to 3D meshes. We demonstrate our system's potential with several examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional subdivision schemes are applied on Euclidean coordinates (the spatial geometry of the control mesh). Although the subdivision limit surfaces are almost everywhere C^2 continuous, their mean-curvature normals are only C^0. In order to generate higher quality surfaces with better-distributed mean-curvature normals, we propose a novel framework to apply subdivision for shape modeling, which combines subdivision with differential shape processing. Our framework contains two parts: subdivision on differential coordinates (a kind of differential geometry of the control mesh), and mutual conversions between Euclidean coordinates and differential coordinates. Further discussions about various strategies in both parts include a special subdivision method for mean-curvature normals, additional surface editing options, and a version of our framework for curve design. Finally, we demonstrate the improvement on surface quality by comparing the results between our framework and traditional subdivision methods.},

  Abstract                 = {We address three related problems. The first problem is to change the volume of a solid by a prescribed amount, while minimizing Hausdorff error. This is important for compensating volume change due to smoothing, subdivision, or advection. The second problem is to preserve the individual areas of infinitely small chunks of a planar shape, as the shape is deformed to follow the gentle bending of a smooth spine (backbone) curve. This is important for bending or animating textured regions. The third problem is to generate consecutive offsets, where each unit element of the boundary sweeps the same region. This is important for constant material-removal rate during numerically controlled (NC) machining. For all three problems, we advocate a solution based on normal offsetting, where the offset distance is a function of local or global curvature measures. We discuss accuracy and smoothness of these solutions for models represented by triangle or quad meshes or, in 2D, by spine-aligned planar quads. We also explore the combination of local distance offsetting with a new selective smoothing process that reduces discontinuities and preserves curvature sign.},
