<h2>Robust Predicates on 80486 and Pentium CPUs</h2>
<hr>
Here's some advice I've received on how to configure Intel CPUs to correctly
execute my code for
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html">arbitrary floating-point precision arithmetic
and robust geometric predicates.</a>
The problem with these CPUs in their default state is that they use
extended precision internal floating-point registers, which defeat
Dekker's standard technique for computing the roundoff error of a
floating-point operation.  These processors can be configured to
round internally stored floating-point values to
single or double precision,
but the commands for doing so are compiler-dependent.<p>

If you wish to use my arithmetic / predicates code on a PC, you will want
to find out what these commands are for your compiler and operating system,
and execute them once at the beginning of your program.  If you wish to use
Triangle on a PC, and want to ensure that Triangle's geometric predicates
are robust, you will want to edit the file "triangle.c" to insert the
commands at the beginning of the procedure <tt>exactinit()</tt>.<p>

Please note that I don't have access to a PC, I haven't tried any of
these modifications myself, and I don't guarantee they'll work.
If you have any corrections to the following information, or know how
to configure Intel (or other) FPUs
under other compilers or operating systems, please send me email
at jrs@cs.cmu.edu.<p>

For Microsoft or Turbo C, add this line near the beginning of your program
(or "triangle.c"), next to the other <tt>#include</tt> statements.

<pre>
#include &lt;float.h&gt;
</pre>

The following statement configures the FPU.  In Triangle, insert it
as the first statement of the procedure <tt>exactinit()</tt>.

<pre>
#ifdef SINGLE
_control87(_PC_24, MCW_PC);     /* set FPU control word for single precision */
#else /* not SINGLE */
_control87(_PC_53, MCW_PC);     /* set FPU control word for double precision */
#endif /* not SINGLE */
</pre>

For gcc running under Linux, the statements are as follows.

<pre>
#include &lt;i386/fpu_control.h&gt;

#ifdef SINGLE
__setfpucw(4210);               /* set FPU control word for single precision */
#else /* not SINGLE */
__setfpucw(4722);               /* set FPU control word for double precision */
#endif /* not SINGLE */
</pre>

Alternatively, the following might also work with gcc, even if you're not
using Linux.  (The definition of <tt>set_ctrlword()</tt> must occur before
the definition of <tt>exactinit()</tt>.)

<pre>
void set_ctrlword(v)
int v;
{
  asm("fldcw %0" :: "m" (v));
}

#ifdef SINGLE
set_ctrlword(4210);             /* set FPU control word for single precision */
#else /* not SINGLE */
set_ctrlword(4722);             /* set FPU control word for double precision */
#endif /* not SINGLE */
</pre>
