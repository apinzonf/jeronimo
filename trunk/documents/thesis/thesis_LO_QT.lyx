In the last two decades three-dimensional modeling methods used by artist
 have been evolving and developing rapidly thanks to the use of vector operators
 of differential geometry how the Laplacian operator this operator allows
 to model in a simple way the behavior of complex applications such as noise
 reduction, enhancement, remeshing, UV mapping, posed, skeletonization,
 among other.
 The Laplacian operator is theoretically defined in a continuous and smooth
 domain named manifold in practice manifolds are often approximated by discrete
 polygon meshes composed by triangles and quadrangles which represent the
 real world three-dimensional objects that artists work.
 In these meshes spectral structure is calculated using a discrete Laplacian
 operator, the discrete version of the Laplacian operator given by Pinkall
 in 1993 works only with triangle meshes, and Xiong in 2011 working exclusively
 with quads meshes.
 This thesis proposes an original extension of the Laplacian operator that
 allows working with hybrid meshes composed by triangles and quadrangles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along with the operator, this work presents new sculpting and modeling applicati
ons with base on the enhancement, applications on subdivision surfaces using
 smoothing, mesh posing using differential coordinates and skeletonization
 using iterative contraction.
 This series of applications demonstrates the quality, predictability and
 flexibility of the proposed operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed operator was successfully used in real production environments
 within software Blender how new tools.
 Currently these tools are available as open source software.

Resumen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
En las dos últimas décadas los métodos de modelado tridimensional han ido
 evolucionando y desarrollándose rápidamente, en parte gracias al uso de
 operadores vectoriales de geometría diferencial como el operador Laplaciano
 ha sido uno de los más ampliamente estudiado y usado gracias a las propiedades
 exhibidas por sus vectores propios en novedosas aplicaciones como: reducción
 de ruido, realce, remallado, mapeo UV, posado, esqueletonización, entre
 otras.
 Este operador diferencial es definido en un dominio continuo y suave llamado
 variedad, las variedades son a menudo aproximadas por mallas discretas
 de polígonos compuestas por triángulos y cuadrángulos que a su vez representan
 objetos tridimensionales del mundo real.
 En estas mallas se calcula la estructura espectral con el uso de algún
 operador Laplaciano discreto, la versión discreta del operador Laplaciano
 propuesta por Pinkall en el 1993 trabaja únicamente con mallas compuestas
 por triángulos, y la de Xiong en el 2011 trabaja exclusivamente con cuadrángulo
s.
 Esta tesis propone una extensión original del Operador Laplaciano que permite
 trabajar con mallas híbridas compuestas por triángulos y cuadrángulos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Junto con el operador, este trabajo presenta nuevas aplicaciones en esculpido
 y modelamiento con base en el realce, aplicaciones en subdivisión de superficie
s con el uso de suavizado, posado de mallas con el uso de coordenadas diferencia
les y esqueletonización usando contracción iterativa.
 Esta serie de aplicaciones demuestra la calidad, predictibilidad y flexibilidad
 del operador propuesto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
El operador propuesto fue usado de forma exitosa en ambientes reales de
 producción dentro del software Blender como nuevas herramientas.
 Actualmente estas herramientas están disponibles como programas de código
 abierto.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discrete versions of Laplace Beltrami Operator have been used in the
 last years for the develop of new geometric modeling tools.
 In the work of Pinkall 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pinkall1993"

\end_inset

 was introduced the cotangent version of Laplace operator, that allow to
 find the minimal surface when compute a discete harmonic map with the Laplacian
 operator, this version has been widely studied and applied in various problems
 of computer geometric modeling.
 The manifolds that are continuous domains homeomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 are represented in computers by polygon meshes.
 These polygons are generally composed of triangles and quadrangles, while
 work with laplacian operator in this hybrid composition are not a mathematical
 challenge, most research uses only meshes composed by triangles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pinkall1993,Desbrun1999,Meyer2003,Sorkine2004,Au2008,Belkin2008,Hahne2006"

\end_inset

, in other recent studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Liu2008,Xiong2011"

\end_inset

 the Laplacian operator is working exclusively with quadrangles.
 But in the artistic scope topology and the way the edges are distributed,
 the triangle and quadrangles, directly affects the processes of animation,
 interpolation, textured, etc.
 As discussed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mullen2007"

\end_inset

 who use a manual connection of a couple of vertices to perform animation
 processes and interpolation.
 It is then of paramount importance to develop operators that easily interact
 with such meshes, eliminating the need of preprocessing the mesh to convert
 it to triangles and change the original topology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modeling techniques able to generate a variety of realistic shapes, have
 been developed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Botsch2006"

\end_inset

.
 Editing techniques have evolved from affine transformations to advanced
 tools like sculpting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Coquillart1990,Galyean1991,Stanculescu2011"

\end_inset

, editing, creation from sketches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Igarashi1999,Gonen2012"

\end_inset

, and complex interpolation techniques 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sorkine2004,Zhou2005"

\end_inset

.
 Catmull-Clark based methods however require to interact with a minimun
 number of control points for any operation to be efficient, or in other
 words, a unicity condition is introduced by demanding a smooth surface
 after any of these shape operations.
 Hence, traditional modeling methods for subdividing surfaces from coarse
 geometry have become widely popular 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Catmull1978,Stam1998"

\end_inset

.
 These works have generalized a uniform B-cubic spline knot insertion to
 meshes, some of them adding some type of control, for instance with the
 use of creases to produce sharp edges 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeRose1998"

\end_inset

, or the modification of some vertex weights to locally control the zone
 of influence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Biermann2000"

\end_inset

.
 Neverteless these methods are difficult to deal with since they require
 a large number of parameters and a very tedious customization.
 Instead, the presented applications requires a single parameter that controls
 the global curvature, which is used to maintain realistic shapes, creating
 a family of different versions of the same object and therefore preserving
 the detail of the original model and a realistic appearance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shape inflation and shape exaggeration can thus be used as such brush
 in the sculpting process, when inflating a shape since current brushes
 end up by losing detail when moving vertices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Stanculescu2011"

\end_inset

.
 In contrast, the presented enhance method inflates a mesh by moving the
 vertices towards the reverse curvature direction, conserving the shape
 and sharp features of the model.

Contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work presents an extension of the Laplace Beltrami Operator for hybrid
 quad/triangle meshes, representing a larger mesh spectrum from what has
 been presented so far.
 The method eliminates the need of preprocessing and allows preservation
 of the original topology.
 Likewise, along with this operator, it is proposed a method to generate
 a family of parameterized shapes, in a robust and predictable way.
 This method enables customization of the smoothness and curvature, obtained
 during the subdivision surfaces process.
 Finally, it is proposed a new brush for inflating the silhouette mesh features
 in modeling and sculpting.

Offset methods for polygon meshing, based on the curvature defined by the

 These methods adjust the shape offset by a constant distance, with enough

 Likewise, curves have been also classified as planar or non-planar, approximate
d by lines, circles, ellipses and other complex shapes.
 In such case, the user defines an initial change over several features
 which is propagated towards other features, based on the classified shapes
 and the inter-relationships between them.
 This method works well with objects that have sharp edges, composed of
 basic geometric shapes such as lines, circles or ellipses.
 However, the method is very limited when models are smooth since it cannot
 find the proper features to edit.

Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper proposes a novel modeling method for a hybrid quad/triangle mesh
 that allows to set a family of possible shapes by controlling a single
 parameter, the global curvature.
 The method uses an original extension of the Laplace Beltrami operator
 that efficiently estimates a curvature parameter which is used to define
 an inflated shape after a particular operation performed in certain mesh
 points.
 Along with the method, this work presents new applications in sculpting
 and modeling, with subdivision of surfaces and weight vertex groups.
 A series of graphics examples demonstrates the quality, predictability
 and flexibility of the method in a real production environment with software
 Blender.

 Catmull-Clark based methods however require to interact with a small number
 of control points for any operation to be efficient, or in other words,
 a unicity condition is introduced by demanding a smooth surface after any
 of these shape operations.
 Hence, traditional modeling methods for subdividing surfaces from coarse
 geometry have become widely popular

 Nevertheless these methods are difficult to deal with since they require
 a large number of parameters and a very tedious customization.
 Instead, the presented method requires a single parameter that controls
 the global curvature, which is used to maintain realistic shapes, creating
 a family of different versions of the same object and therefore preserving
 the detail of the original model and a realistic appearance.

 It is then of paramount importance to develop operators that easily interact
 with such meshes, eliminating the need of preprocessing the mesh to convert
 it to triangles.
 The shape inflation and shape exaggeration can thus be used as such brush
 in the sculpting process, when inflating a shape since current brushes
 end up by losing detail when moving vertices

\begin_layout Standard
This work presents an extension of the Laplace Beltrami operator for hybrid
 quad/triangle meshes, representing a larger mesh spectrum from what has
 been presented so far.
 The method eliminates the need of preprocessing and allows preservation
 of the original topology.
 Likewise, along with this operator, it is proposed a method to generate
 a family of parametrized shapes, in a robust and predictable way.
 This method enables customization of the smoothness and curvature, obtained
 during the subdivision surfaces process.
 Finally, it is proposed a new brush for inflating the silhouette mesh features
 in modeling and sculpting.

Many tools have been developed for modeling, based on the Laplacian mesh
 processing.
 Thanks to the advantages of the Laplacian operator, these different tools
 preserve the surface geometric details when using them for different processes
 such as free-form deformation, fusion, morphing and other applications

Offset methods for polygon meshing, based on the curvature defined by the
 Laplace Beltrami operator, have been developed.
 These methods adjust the shape offset by a constant distance, with enough
 precision.
 Nevertheless, these methods fail to conserve sufficient detail because
 of the smoothing, a crucial issue which depends on the offset size

 In volumetric approaches, in case of point-based representations, the offset
 boundary computation is based on the distance field and therefore when

, and angle-based threshold.
 Likewise, curves have been also classified as planar or non-planar, approximate
d by lines, circles, ellipses and other complex shapes.
 In such case, the user defines an initial change over several features
 which is propagated towards other features, based on the classified shapes
 and the inter-relationships between them.
 This method works well with objects that have sharp edges, composed of
 basic geometric shapes such as lines, circles or ellipses.
 However, the method is very limited when models are smooth since it cannot
 find the proper features to edit.

Proposed Method

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method exaggerates a shape using a Laplacian smoothing operator in
 the reverse direction, i.e., the new shape is a modified version in which
 those areas with larger curvature are magnified.
 The operator amounts to a generator of a set of models which conserves
 the basic silhouette of the original shape.
 In addition, the presented approach can be easily mixed with traditional
 or uniform subdivision of surfaces.
 This method is based on an original extension of the Laplace Beltrami operator
 for hybrid quad/triangle meshes, mixing arbitrary types of meshes, exploiting
 the basic geometrical relationships and ensuring good results with few
 algorithm iterations.

The method was devised to use with weighted vertex groups, which specify
 the final shape inflation of the solution, meaning $0$ as no changes and
 1 when a maximal change is applied.
 The weights modify the influence zones, where the Laplacian is applied,
 as shown in equation

 be counteracted with a simple volume preservation.
 However, the mesh may suffer large displacements when

A new sculpting brush is herein proposed and aims to inflate the shape,
 magnifying the shape curvatures of a polygon mesh in real time.
 This brush works properly with the stroke method 
\shape slanted
Drag Dot

, allowing to pre-visualize the model changes before the mouse is released.
 Also, it allows to move the mouse along the model to match the shape zone
 which is supposed to be inflated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Brushes that perform a similar inflation can introduce mesh distortions
 or produce mesh self-intersections, provided these brushes only move the
 vertices along the normal without any global information.
 In contrast, the present method searches for a proper inflation while preservin
g the global curvature, retaining the original shape and main model features.
 In addition, this method simplifies the work required for the inflation
 since it needs not different brushes for inflating, softening or styling.
 The inflated brush can make all these operation in a single step.
 Real-time brushes require the Laplacian matrix is constructed with the
 vertices that are within the sphere radius defined by the user, reducing
 the matrix to be processed, the center of this sphere depending on the
 place where the user clicks on the canvas and the three-dimensional mesh
 placed where the click is projected.
 Special handling is required for the boundary vertices with neighbors that
 are not within the brush radius: these vertices are marked as boundary
 and the curvature is not there calculated, but they must be included in
 the matrix so that every vertex has their corresponding neighbors within
 the selection.
 The sculpting Laplacian matrix reads as.

Catmull-Clark subdivision surface methods generate smooth and continuous
 models from a coarse model and produce quick results because of the simplicity
 of implementation.
 Nevertheless, changes to the global curvature are hardly implantable.
 The Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces together with shape inflation can
 easily generate families of shapes by changing a single parameter, allowing
 to handle a model with very few vertices.
 In practice, this would allow an artist to choose a model from a similar
 set of options that would meet his/her needs without having to change each
 of the control vertices.
 Likewise, the presented method allows the use of vertex weight paint over
 the control points.
 The weights can be applied to a coarse model, followed by a Catmull-Clark
 subdivision where weights are interpolated, producing weights with smooth
 changes in the influence zones, as shown in figure

 In this figure, the animation shows some camel poses during a walk, the

 Local modifications produced by the pose interpolation or animation rigging
 practically do not affect the result.
 In spite of at any pose of the camel legs there is a clear difference,
 the inflation method allows a flesh-like shape in the original pattern
 produced by the artist.
 This is due to the mesh restricted diffusion process so that small local
 changes are treated without affecting the global solution.
 The method therefore is rotation invariant since it depends exclusively
 on the normal mesh field, which is rotation invariant.

 These models were sculpted with the shape inflate brush, at each step the

 The processing time for 800 vertices in the camel paw (40k model) only
 took 0.1 seconds, for 2600 vertices in the leg and neck (model 40k) took
 0.5 seconds, these times are suitable in real applications since an artist
 sculpts a model for parts.

 Working with the Blender allowed to test the method interactively against
 others, as Catmull-Clark, weight vertex groups and sculpting system in
 Blender.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To improve the performance, it was worked with the Blender mesh struct,
 visiting each triangle or quad and storing its corresponding index and
 the sum of the Laplacian weights of the ring in a list so that only two
 visits were required for the list of mesh faces and two times the edge
 list, if the mesh was not closed.
 This drastically reduced calculations, enabling real-time processing.
 In the construction of the Laplacian matrix, several index were locked
 at vertices having face areas or edge lengths with zero value that could
 cause spikes and bad results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under these conditions, the matrix at equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "PAPER:eq:TQLBO_Simple_Matrix"

\end_inset

 is sparse since the number of neighbors per vertex, corresponding to the
 number of data per row, is smaller compared to the total number of vertices
 in the mesh.
 To solve the linear system equation

This work presented an extension of the Laplace Beltrami operator for hybrid
 quad/triangle meshes that can be used in production environments and provides
 results similar to those obtained by working only with triangles or quads.
 This paper has introduced a new way to change silhouettes in a mesh for
 modeling or sculpting in a few steps by means of the curvature model modificati
on while preserving its overall shape.
 In addition, a new modeling method has also been presented some possible
 applications have been illustrated.
 The method works properly with isometric transformations, opening the possibili
ty of introducing it on the process of animation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We show that this tool may work in early modeling stages, case in which
 coarse models are used, allowing to modify the shape generated by the Catmull-C
lark subdivision surfaces, and thereby avoiding edition of the vertices
 with change of a single parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future work includes the analysis of theoretical relationships between the
 Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces and the Laplacian smoothing since they
 can produce very similar results.

Mesh Smoothing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common way to attenueate noise in a polygonal mesh is through a diffusion
 process 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Taubin1995,Desbrun1999"

\end_inset

.
 Laplacian smooth techniques over a diffusion process allow a proper noise
 reduction on the mesh surface with minimal shape changes, while still preservin
g a desirable geometry as well as the original shape.
 The simple idea is that the vertices are moved in the direction of the
 Laplacian when we use the contangent version the vertices are moved in
 the direction of the curvature flow.
 The complexity of Laplacian smoothing can be linear in time and space with
 a fast convergence and the diffussion proccess can attenuate noise with
 only one iteration due the sparseness of the laplacian operator.

For non-close meshes or meshes with holes is not posibble to compute the
 curvature flow.
 For this reason the system smooths the edges differently within the diffusion
 process.
 The bondaries are treated as a one-dimensional curve.
 In a curve the Laplacian is defined as the weighted difference between
 the vertex and the two immediate neighbors, thus ensures the curve maintained
 its original form as much as possible.
 We define a Laplacian for mesh smoothing as a matrix equation.

Laplacian Deform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Laplacian deform allows to pose a mesh while preserving geometric details
 of the surface.
 This method allows to defines a set of anchor vertices, and then moves
 some of them around.
 The system keeps the rest of the anchor vertices in fixed positions, and
 calculates the best possible locations of all the remaining vertices to
 preserve the original geometric details.

 for mesh deformations, delete the use of static vertices and allow application
 of this system in hybrid meshes composes by triangles and quads with the
 TQLBO proposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method captures the geometric details using a differential coordinates
 representations.
 The differential coordinates captures the local geometric information (curvatur
e and direction) of the vertex based on its neighbors how show in figure

 We choose the implementacion of LU factorizacion in a OpenNL-SuperLU library,
 because this method show the better performance for the computacion of
 a solution for a Laplacian Deform linear system of equations presented
 in equation

 shows the Laplacian Deform applied in a model with 173K vertices, only
 anchor vertices was used and are represented in blue color, when the user
 apply several transformation (location, rotation, scale) over this anchors
 vertices, the system find a solution and estimate the position of the vetices
 in yellow color.
 This method work in real time, to achieve this the matrix

 is decomposed in matrix

 with LU factorization only one time when the system init.
 Once the matrix is factorized the system can solve the unknowns in a fast
 way in term of miliseconds.
 For get better results the method permits solve several times the system
 of equations, and not need factorize matriz LU could be that at every iteration
, only the differential coordinates are adjust since the differential coordinate
s can be rotated at every iteration and get bettter results.
 In the figure only four iterations were used, but the system find good
 solutions with only one iteration when the angle of rotations are less

\begin_layout Standard
This work presented an extension of the Laplace Beltrami operator for hybrid
 quad/triangle meshes that can be used in production environments and provides
 results similar to those obtained by working only with triangles or quads.
 This paper has introduced a new way to change silhouettes in a mesh for
 modeling or sculpting in a few steps by means of the curvature model modificati
on while preserving its overall shape.
 In addition, a new modeling method has also been presented some possible
 applications have been illustrated.
 The method works properly with isometric transformations, opening the possibili
ty of introducing it on the process of animation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We show that this tool may work in early modeling stages, case in which
 coarse models are used, allowing to modify the shape generated by the Catmull-C
lark subdivision surfaces, and thereby avoiding edition of the vertices
 with change of a single parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future work includes the analysis of theoretical relationships between the
 Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces and the Laplacian smoothing since they
 can produce very similar results.
